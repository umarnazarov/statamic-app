If Spurs accept the offer Sky Sports News believes the transfer could happen quickly.

Kane could potentially earn in the region of Â£11m net annually over the course of a five-year contract. That will be broken down into basic salary, number of games played and bonuses.

Tottenham's record scorer also hasn't ruled out returning to the Premier League in future.

Kane scored 30 Premier League goals last season in a disappointing campaign for Spurs as they finished eighth to miss out on European football, while they remain without a trophy since 2008.

Kane is Tottenham's all-time record goalscorer with 280 goals in 435 appearances, having scored his first Spurs goal in December 2011.

He has scored 213 goals in 320 Premier League games and is currently 48 goals off breaking Alan Shearer's record as the highest scorer in Premier League history.
